# RailsProject
This project is a cinema application built with Ruby on Rails.

This application is founded upon connections between three models, the cinema, theatre, and movie. A cinema has many theatres, and each theatre belongs to a movie and a cinema, thus a cinema has many movies through theatres. A movie has many cinemas through theatres as well.

Users may sign in normally or sign in with github. After a user has signed in, they are granted full access to the application. They may view cinemas, movies, and theatres, and create them and the relationships between them. Users may also search for movies. When a user views a show page of any of the movies or cinema, all info about what movies the cinemas are playing, or which cinemas a movie is playing at.
